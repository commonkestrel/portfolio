                <p>
                    I'm <span class="highlight">Jett</span>, an aspiring computer engineer and a senior at [redacted] High School!
                    Subjects I am passionate about include software & electrical engineering, CAD, robotics, and occasionally photography.
                    Some aspects I am particularly interested in are kernel, OS, and programming language development, as well as embedded firmware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am the current President and Software Lead of my school's robotics team.
                    I also am a member of my local Outrigger Canoe team.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I joined my school's robotics club over the summer of 2022, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.
                    It was over that summer that I learned about FIRST Robotics; The competition that our club competes in is essentially a sports match
                    between robots build by teams of high-schoolers from all around the world. 
                    Over the last 2Â½ years I have devoted thousands of hours to not just building the best robots we can build,
                    but also to building the best community I could within the club.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After becoming Vice President after just a single year with the club, I used the knowledge I had gained from out 2023 season 
                    to build the club's communication, organization, and design processes to new hights.
                    These efforts clearly paid off, with the 2024 season marking the first regional win and World Championships qualification in our team's history.
                    As the robot driver for all four events in our 2024 season, and both in our 2023 season,
                    I gained a unique perspective for just how much our team had grown.
                    There was a massive increase in reliability, quality, and professionalism that, while present during 2023,
                    had truly breached new ground in our team's path to greatness.
                    I could not have done anything I have in the club without the rigourous insign given to me by the previous members of the team,
                    of course, and I hope to become as much as an inspiration to our newest recruits as they were to me.
